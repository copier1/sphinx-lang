An intepreter for a dynamic language inspired by Lua and Python, see ``syntax_examples.sph``.

Mainly a learning project, this is heavily WIP.

# Sphinx

Welcome to the Sphinx programming language! Sphinx is (or will be) a dynamically typed programming language that is heavily inspired by Lua and Python, and implemented entirely in Rust!

The goal is to eventually have a (dynamic) structurally typed programming language that also includes static type checking using type annotations and inference (in the same vein as PyType).
However, for the time being the main focus is on just getting the language up and running. 

The plan is first - an interpreter, then compilation to bytecode and a VM - then static analysis during the bytecode compilation step.
