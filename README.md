An intepreter for a simple dynamic language inspired by Lua and Python, see ``syntax_examples.rlo``.

Mainly a learning project, this is heavily WIP.

It does include an extensible rule-based lexing engine written in Rust.

I am using a grammar file to document the language, however the goal is to write the parser myself, in Rust.
